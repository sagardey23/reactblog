A sort of Indian pancake, dosas are made from a thin batter consisting of rice, flour and lentils. Making dosas is no easy task, with the batter mixture having to soak in water for at least 24 hours before it can be shaped. Once ready, the batter is ladled onto a hot tava (griddle pan) and shaped in a similar way to how the French would shape a crepe."
